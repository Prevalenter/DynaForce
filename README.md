# **DynaForce: Sensorless Contact Estimation for Dexterous Manipulation**

üîó [Project Homepage](https://sites.google.com/view/dex-sensorless/)

**DynaForce** is an open-source framework that estimates contact forces from joint torques using robotic dynamics, enabling **sensorless force estimation** in dexterous manipulation tasks.

> **Note:** This paper is currently under review. Additional code and resources will be released upon acceptance.

## üöß TODO

- [x] Identify base inertia parameters for the robot hand  
- [x] Implement momentum-based collision detection  
- [x] Expand PyQt UI for easier finger/link selection  
- [ ] Validate real-world force estimation via collision experiments  
- [ ]  Training code for imitation learning

## ‚öôÔ∏è Installation

First, install the [SymPyBotics](https://github.com/cdsousa/SymPyBotics)
```bash
git clone https://github.com/cdsousa/SymPyBotics.git
cd sympybotics
python setup.py install
```

Then, clone the repository and navigate into the directory:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Prevalenter/DynaForce.git
```

- Python 3.8 is required.
- If you want to try the **interactive simulation demo**, make sure to install **PyQt5**.
- All package versions are listed in [`utils/python_version.txt`](utils/python_version.txt).

If you have any questions, please submit an issue.

## üìñ Project Overview

The repository is organized to support both simulation and real-world experiments for dynamic identification and force estimation.

-   `data/`: Contains robot models (`.pkl`), sample motion data, and identification results.
-   `ident/`: Core scripts for identification and estimation.
    -   `ident/real/`: Scripts for experiments with the real robot, including multi-algorithm identification (`ident_multi_algo.py`) and momentum-based force prediction (`fore_calibrate/pred_momentum.py`).
    -   `ident/sim/`: Scripts for simulation, including an interactive demo with a GUI (`sim_interaction_qt.py`).
-   `utils/`: Utility functions, including robot model generation and data processing.

The typical workflow involves:
1.  Running an identification script from `ident/real/` to compute the robot's dynamic parameters from collected data.
2.  Using these parameters in either the simulation (`ident/sim/`) or real-world force estimation scripts.
